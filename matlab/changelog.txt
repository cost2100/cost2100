2011.11.24 Meifang Zhu
calc_pathloss.m:
'300MHz_FOI' for outdoor scenario is added

2012.02.02 Meifang Zhu
get_cluster.m: 
changed the link delay between multiple interacting clusters into exponential distribution

2012.02.02 Meifang Zhu
Some functions related to multiple link simulation are changed back into version COST2100.2.2.1: get_channel.m, get_VR.m, get_VRtable.m.

2013.1.17 Meifang Zhu
get_para.m:
'300MHz_FOI' for outdoor scenario is included, and multiple link simulation for outdoor LOS scenario is implemented

2013.1.17 Meifang Zhu
cost2100.m:
a new variable, Nlink, for single and multiple link simulation is added.

2013.2.15 Meifang Zhu
get_dipole_G: generates a theoretical dipole array response, the number of antennas can be set by users and the distance between two dipole 
is half a wavelentgh. Renamed the scenarios to reflect the measured environments.

2017.10.20 Jose Flordelis, Sara Gunnarsson
Merged MAMMOET Massive MIMO extension with previous code base. 
Code restructured for back-compatibility. 
Some bugs have been fixed.

2018.10.01 Jose Flordelis, Sara Gunnarsson
Some modifications to MAMMOET Massive MIMO extensions (get_BS_VR_para.m).
Some bugs have been fixed (create_IR_Cyl_EADF.m, get_channel_los.m, get_mpc.m, get_MS_VR.m, update_chan.m).
Some efficiency improvment have been implemented (create_IR_omni_MIMO_VLA.m, get_channel.m, update_chan.m).
